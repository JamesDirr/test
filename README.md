# Shortest path algorithm 
To run files create a new java project and add all files to the src folder. 
Then run the main method and follow the promts in the console. 
provied graph.txt is the graph that i used and can be used to play around with or can create your own.
Youcan create your own edge by edge while running the program or create a similar text file to mine.
Each edge should be writen as "FirstNodeInt" "SecondNodeInt" "DistaceDouble"
so node space node space distance then each on thier own line.
